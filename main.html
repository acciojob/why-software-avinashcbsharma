	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        <b>1. What does a software developer do?</b><br>
        A software developer is an expert in computer programming and 
        software engineering. Software developers typically write, test, 
        and maintain all the computer codes that allow a computer program to run. 
        They are the brains behind the programs that make all the computers and 
        technology of the world work. In addition to writing computer code, they 
        often purchase, test and recommend new computer systems, tools and applications. 
        Software developers are the people who develop new software and update older 
        software. You can think of a software developer as being a little like a 
        carpenter: you can build a new house, or remodel an old one, but you can't do 
        much with wood without the right tools. Software developers are the tools that 
        make it possible for software engineers and designers to work, and you can't 
        do much of anything with software without them. <br><br>
        <b>2. How much does a software developer earn?</b><br>
        A software developer can earn almost anything from $25,000 to $250,000 per annum. 
        However, the median salary is $92,000 per annum. There are many factors that contribute 
        to this amount of salary. For example, the industry and the company where a software 
        developer works, the size of the company, the location of the company, the experience 
        of the software developer, the reputation and the specialty of the software developer 
        are some of the important factors. It is also important to note that the salary of a 
        software developer will not be the same everywhere, it will be different in every 
        country and state.
